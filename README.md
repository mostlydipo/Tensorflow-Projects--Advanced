### Neural network sms text classifier:
#### Created a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.

#### The final prediction craetes a list with the first element in the list being a number between zero and one that indicates the likeliness of "ham" (0) or "spam" (1). The second element in the list is a word "ham" or "spam", depending on which is most likely.

### Linear regression health cost calculator:
#### Predicted healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.
#### The aim is for the model to return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.
