# Tensorflow-Projects--Advanced
Machine learning with python projects using Tensorflow. The projects here are final tasks from Freecodecamp after 300hours of learning for the completion of each project.

## Neural network sms text classifier:
Created a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
The final prediction craetes a list with the first element in the list being a number between zero and one that indicates the likeliness of "ham" (0) or "spam" (1). The second element in the list is a word "ham" or "spam", depending on which is most likely.

## Linear regression health cost calculator:
Predicted healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. The aim is for the model to return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.

## Book recommendation sysytem using KNN:
using a dataset containing 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users. After importing and cleaning the data, NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors was developed to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures the distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.

## Cat and Dog image classifier using Tensorflow and Keras:
Completed the code to classify images of dogs and cats. Using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit for 70% accuracy!).
